# Avatar desktop library

## Installation steps (yarn)

1. Tell yarn where to find packages starting with `@buffgame`. In your project's root directory, add the following contents to the `.yarnrc` file:

        "@buffgame:registry" "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
        always-auth true

2. Authorize yarn to download this package, because BUFF is a private GitHub organization.

    - First, generate a personal access token (PAT) for your GitHub account on [this link](https://github.com/settings/tokens). The required scope is `read:packages`.

    - Then run the following command using **npm**.

            npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken <PAT>

        **Important**: You cannot use `yarn config set` to set the token. ðŸ¤·

3. Verify that your token is set using `yarn config list`.

4. Install the package as usual:

        yarn add @buffgame/avatar.desktop-lib
